I am PhD candidate and researcher at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu), [North Carolina State University (NCSU)](https://www.ncsu.edu). I am advised by [Dr. Willam Enck](https://enck.org) at the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR)](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu) Lab. I completed my BSc (Major in Computer Science and Engineering) and MSc (Major in Computer Science) from the same institute in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

My research leverages emerging technologies, like Software Defined Networks, to design novel security enhancements for networks and systems, including enterprise on-premises networks, cloud, and 5G infrastructure. My principal methodology seeks to understand and then minimize network and system threats through new architectural design principles.
In the process, I integrate knowledge from access control frameworks,
software-defined networks and reactive forwarding; deception techniques and probabilistic model
checkers; game-theoretic models; network performance analysis, security analysis; and Internet and
Telephone Networks. My research to date can be broadly categorized into three areas: 1) Least
privilege access control for enterprise networks, 2) Role-Based deception in enterprise networks, and
3) Communication in wireless and 5G infrastructures.

Throughout my career, I have also accumulated substantial teaching and mentoring experience. I instructed several courses and labs in multiple universities during my professional life back in Bangladesh. As a lecturer at the [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/), I performed research mentorships similar to that of a tenured track faculty member. I am on study leave now.  I also have teaching experience at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd). During my graduate studies at NC State, I acquired experiences in teaching assistantship and mentored more than five graduate students.

I have a lovely [family](/images/family.png) with twin girls and my spouse.
