I am PhD candidate and researcher at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu), [North Carolina State University (NCSU)](https://www.ncsu.edu). I am advised by [Dr. Willam Enck](https://enck.org) at the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR)](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu) Lab. 

My research is dedicated to designing and improving enterprise network security, particularly on on-premises resources. My research integrates the access control model, deception and reactive forwarding of SDN (Software Defined Network) to defend against Ransomeware and APT (Advance Persistent Threat) attacks. This work has addressed the problem of insider threats from both compromised network devices and hosts. In the future, I envision leveraging my knowledge in access control models, probabilistic model checking, SDN, and security analysis to secure all the aspects of enterprise networks, which includes technologies like the Cloud, 5G infrastructure and IoT (Internet of Things). 

Prior to joining NCSU, I used to be teaching faculty at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](), [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/). I am on study leave now. I completed my BSc (Major in Computer Science and Engineering) and MSc (Major in Computer Science) from the same institute in 2012 and 2015, respectively. I also have teaching experience at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd). 

I have a lovely [family](/images/family.png) with twin girls and my spouse, who works as a Senior Software Engineer at [Visa](https://usa.visa.com).
