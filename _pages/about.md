I am PhD candidate and researcher at the Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University (NCSU). I am advised by [Dr. Willam Enck](https://enck.org) at the [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research (WSPR)](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu) Lab. I completed my BSc (Major in Computer Science and Engineering) and MSc (Major in Computer Science) from [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/) in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

My research leverages emerging technologies, like Software Defined Networks, to design novel security enhancements for networks and systems, including enterprise on-premises networks, cloud, and 5G infrastructure. My principal methodology seeks to understand and then minimize network and system threats through new architectural design principles.
In the process, I integrate knowledge from access control frameworks,
software-defined networks and reactive forwarding; deception techniques and probabilistic model
checkers; game-theoretic models; network performance analysis, security analysis; and Internet and
Telephone Networks. My research to date can be broadly categorized into three areas: 1) Least
privilege access control for enterprise networks, 2) Role-Based deception in enterprise networks, and
3) Communication in wireless and 5G infrastructures.

Throughout my career, I have also accumulated substantial teaching and mentoring experience. I instructed several courses and labs in multiple universities during my professional life back in Bangladesh. As a lecturer at the University of Dhaka, I performed research mentorships similar to that of a tenured track faculty member. I am on study leave now.  I also have teaching experience at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd). During my graduate studies at NC State, I acquired experiences in teaching assistantship and mentored more than five graduate students.

I have a lovely [family](/images/family.png) with twin girls and my spouse.
