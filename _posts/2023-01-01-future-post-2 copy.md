As enterprises move from the wired network to 5G cellular, there is a need to migrate the access control enforcement from the wired network to the 5G network. To achieve this, we define policies between enterprise end-hosts using the NGAC policy language. And develop a custom policy network function in 5G core that takes the NGAC policy, transforms the access control rules to a 5G specified format, and feeds those rule into the Network Repository Function (NRF). This work is funded by the **Office of Naval Research**.
