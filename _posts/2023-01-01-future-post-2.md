Current Project 2: Security Analysis of Next Generation Access Control
====
To analyze NIST Next Generation Access Control, we follow the application-independent approach; later, we will expand it for particular application scenarios (like MSNetViews, and NetViews). We want to verify that the interplay among the policy classes is more restrictive than the individual policy class. We want to ensure that the dynamic policy update using obligation does not violate the access control policyâ€™s security properties. Furthermore, we envision formalizing the multi-tenant or multi-administration policy definition of NGAC. <sub>This work is also funded by the **Office of Naval Research**</sub>.
