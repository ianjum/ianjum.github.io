I taught two courses (*Compiler Design & Construction* and *Introduction to Computer Science*) as primary instructor over the course of 2014 to 2016. I have also instructed in several labs (*Data Structures*, *Algorithms*, *Digital Logic Design*, *Microprocessors*, *Artificial Intelligence*, and *Database Systems*) and helped the primary instructor.
