Lecturer, Department of CSE, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh
======
I taught two courses (*Compiler Design & Construction* and *Computer Architecture & Organization*) as primary instructor over the course of 2016 to 2018. I have also instructed in several labs (*Introduction to Programming Language*, *Algorithms*, and *Data and Telecommunication Systems*) and helped the primary instructor accordingly.
