I worked as a Teaching Assistant in *CSC216 Software Development Fundamentals*, where I introduced the students to the basics of Software Development in Object Oriented Language of JAVA. I also taught them the implementation of large programming projects using object-oriented design techniques. I also worked in the *CSC230 C and Software Tools* course, where I introduced the students to the basics of the C programming language and its application to system-level programming, speed and efficiency of execution and basics of simulations and modeling. I helped the professor by conducting lectures and preparing exams and labs. I assisted in one graduate-level introduction to computer and network security and privacy, titled *CSC574 Computer and Network Security*. I helped the professor design lectures, exams, research projects, and grading.
